Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography
Project Overview
This project implements steganography for securely hiding text messages within images. The aim is to offer an alternative to traditional encryption methods by embedding secret messages into multimedia files in a way that is imperceptible to the human eye. The technique involves modifying image pixel values to store the hidden data while maintaining the visual integrity of the image.

Problem Statement
In the digital era, secure communication is paramount. While encryption provides strong protection, it can be flagged or intercepted. Steganography avoids such detection by hiding messages inside images, making it an effective tool for covert communication. This project focuses on achieving high security through pixel value modification and a passcode-based decryption system.

Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
OpenCV (cv2) - For image processing
OS (os) - For file handling and system operations
Platform: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux
